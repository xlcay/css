<h2 style="font-size: 32px;">Why Galatasaray have been the best side in the Süper Lig under Okan Buruk – scout report</h2>
<p class="content">Since the appointment of Okan Buruk in June 2022, Galatasaray, the historical champion of Turkish football, have made constant progress which was evident recently when they defeated their rival Fenerbahçe 3-0 in the Süper Lig.</p>
<p class="content">Okan Buruk who played for 11 years with the Turkish giant, winning six leagues and a single UEFA Cup, arrived after Domenec Torrent, Pep Guardiola’s assistant in <a style="color: red;" href="https://totalfootballanalysis.com/category/teams/barcelona"> Barcelona</a>,<a style="color: red;" href="https://totalfootballanalysis.com/category/teams/bayern-munich"> Bayern Munich</a> and <a style="color: red;" href="https://totalfootballanalysis.com/category/teams/manchester-city">Manchester City</a>, and after Fatih Terim the historical club manager. Okan Buruk had yet to manage one of the elite Turkish sides before his arrival but helped Istanbul Başakşehir to their first league in 2020.</p>
<p class="content">This season <a style="color: red;" href="https://www.newsnow.co.uk/h/Sport/Football/Europe/Turkey/Galatasaray">Galatasaray</a> are showing tactical diversity and enthusiasm to play modern football with the strategy of their new coach, and this tactical analysis, in the form of a team scout report, will provide an analysis of these strategies and tactics both in possession and out of possession, to observe how he succeeded to bring Galatasaray again to the top of the Süper Lig.</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 32px; font-style: oblique;">Formations & stats</h2>
<p class="content">Okan Buruk with Cimbom in his first season has an impact on the team’s performance. He is concentrating his principles and tactics around 4-2-3-1 for the majority of the season and occasionally transforming to 4-4-2 or 4-1-3-2 shapes as the below graphic shows.</p>

<p class="content">The 4-2-3-1 base formation variations give him the possibility to be flexible and surprising with his tactics.</p>
<p class="content">Galatasaray, with Okan Buruk, keep an average possession rate of 55.69% and averaged 460.09 passes per match (84.7% accuracy), also maintaining 153.44 forward passes per game (76.9% accuracy), 55.56 passes to the final third (71.8% accuracy) and 72.84 progressive passes (76.9% accuracy).</p>
<p class="content">Furthermore, Cimbom are scoring 1.81 goals per 90 from 2.13 xG. The defensive security is even more impressive and they conceded the fewest goals (13 goals) in their league. They conceded only 0.94 goals per 90 from 1 xG, a single goal per game.</p>
<p class="content">They intend to progress rapidly and vertically in the optimal moment and aim to create superiority all around the pitch.</p>
<h2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 32px; font-style: oblique;">Build-up & Progression</h2>
<p class="content">Galatasaray desire to build up play with the fewest number of players while the others are behind the opponent’s midfield or pinning the backline, using diversly a 2-3-5 and 3-2-5 with asymmetric fullbacks and implementing the different instructions from the double-pivot and also using the wingers to confuse the opponent while keeping depth and width as much as they can to distort them.</p><p style="color: darkgoldenrod;
font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Below against Kasımpaşa’s high pressing, Galatasaray implemented a 3-1 base. Here, While Dries Mertens was pinning the opponent’s #6 and Kerem Aktürkoğlu was dragging the opponent’s fullback, the different roles between Lucas Torreira and Sergio Oliveira were highlighted. The former Roma man moved higher to exploit the space.
